#AEM Training 

Getting started with AEM
------------------

I propose a series of practical exercises that will allow you to quickly gain expertise on the AEM platform. Each practical exercise is presented with a Git branch

Example:
---------
git checkout tp1

You will find a README on each practical exercise, which presents the practice we will try to learn.
